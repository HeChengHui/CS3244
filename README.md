# CS3244 Project  
In this project, my group and I attempts to predict resale flat prices using the data provided by [data.gov](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices). More specifically, we decided to focus on the SengKang area due to popularity as of time of writing. Several Machine Learning techniques were employed, mainly regression based to predict future pricings.
What I have done is provided in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OW00DccNalIgU3nT2DFOsyTI0beqW6Ei?authuser=1#scrollTo=G7XB2tuPuQ4I).
